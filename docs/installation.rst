Installation

Stable release
--------------

To install xCDAT using Conda, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install xcdat

This is the preferred method to install xCDAT, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have Conda installed, this `Miniconda installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
