xCDAT: Xarray Climate Data Analysis Tools
=======================================================

xCDAT is an extension of `xarray`_ for climate data analysis on structured grids. It serves as a spiritual successor to the Community Data Analysis Tools (`CDAT`_) library.

The goal of xCDAT is to provide generalizable climate domain features and general utilities in xarray, which includes porting some core CDAT functionalities. xCDAT leverages several powerful libraries in the xarray ecosystem (e.g., `xESMF`_ and `cf_xarray`_) to deliver robust APIs. The xCDAT core team is aiming to provide a maintainable and extensible package that serves the needs of the climate community in the long-term.

A major design philosophy of xCDAT is streamlining the user experience while developing code to analyze climate data. This means reducing the complexity and number of lines required to achieve certain features with xarray.

Getting Started
---------------

This `documentation page <https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ provides guidance for setting up your environment on your `computer <https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_ generally or on an `HPC/Jupyter <https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-hpc-jupyter.html>`_ environment. We also include an `API Overview <https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ and `Gallery <https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html>`_ to highlight xCDAT functionality.

xCDAT invites discussion on version releases, architecture, new feature suggestions, and other topics on the `GitHub discussion <https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/discussions>`_ page. Users and contributors can also view and open issues on our `GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/issues>`_.

We welcome and appreciate contributions to xCDAT. If you'd like to help improve xCDAT, please checkout our `Contributing Guide <https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_.

Planned Features
-----------------

Initial planned features include:

* Extension of xarray's ``open_dataset()`` and ``open_mfdataset()`` with post-processing options

  * Generate bounds for axes supported by ``xcdat`` if they don't exist in the Dataset
  * Optional decoding non-CF time units, in addition to CF time units (already supported in ``xarray``)
  * Optional centering of time coordinates using time bounds
  * Optional conversion of longitudinal axis orientation between [0, 360) and [-180, 180)

* Temporal averaging

  * Time series averages (single snapshot and grouped), climatologies, and departures
  * Weighted or unweighted
  * Optional seasonal configuration (e.g., DJF vs. JFD, custom seasons)

* Geospatial weighted averaging

  * Support rectilinear grid
  * Optional specification of regional domain

* Horizontal structured regridding

  * Support rectilinear and cuvilinear grids
  * Python implementation of `regrid2`_ for handling cartesian latitude longitude grids
  * API that wraps `xESMF`_ with utilities to handle edge cases

* Vertical structured regridding

  * Support rectilinear and cuvilinear grids

Things we are striving for:

* Support for CF compliant, E3SM non-CF compliant, and common metadata

  * xCDAT primarily focuses on datasets that follow the `CF convention`_. xCDAT leverages `cf_xarray`_ to interpret CF convention attributes on ``xarray`` objects
  * Accomodations for specific non-CF compliant situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis

* Robust handling of coordinates and its associated bounds

  * Coordinate variables are retrieved with ``cf_xarray`` using either the ``"axis"``, ``"standard_name"``, or dimension name attribute
  * Bounds are retrieved with ``cf_xarray`` using the ``"bounds"`` attr
  * Ability to operate on both longitudinal axis orientations, [0, 360) and [-180, 180)

* Support for parallelism using `dask`_ where it is both possible and makes sense
