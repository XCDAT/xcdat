xCDAT: Xarray Climate Data Analysis Tools
=======================================================

xCDAT is an extension of `xarray`_ for climate data analysis on structured grids.
It serves as a spiritual successor to the Community Data Analysis Tools (`CDAT`_) library.

Planned Features
-----------------

The goal of xCDAT is to provide climate domain specific features and general utilities with xarray.

Initial features include:

* Extension of xarray's ``open_dataset()`` and ``open_mfdataset()`` with post-processing options

  * Generate bounds for axes supported by ``xcdat`` if they don't exist in the Dataset
  * Optional decoding non-CF time units, in addition to CF time units (already supported in ``xarray``)
  * Optional centering of time coordinates using time bounds
  * Optional conversion of longitudinal axis orientation between [0, 360) and [-180, 180)

* Temporal averaging

  * Time series averages (single snapshot and grouped), climatologies, and departures
  * Weighted or unweighted
  * Optional seasonal configuration

* Geospatial weighted averaging

  * Support rectilinear grid
  * Optional specification of regional domain

* Horizontal structured regridding

  * Support rectilinear and cuvilinear grids
  * Python implementation of `regrid2`_ for handling cartesian latitude longitude grids
  * API that wraps `xesmf`_ with utilities to handle edge cases

* Vertical structured regridding

  * Support rectilinear and cuvilinear grids

Things we are striving for:

* Support for CF compliant, E3SM non-CF compliant, and common metadata

  * Leverage `cf_xarray`_ to interpret `CF convention`_ attributes on ``xarray`` objects

* Robust handling of coordinates and its associated bounds

  * Coordinates and bounds are retrieved with ``cf_xarray`` using the standard ``axis`` and ``coordinate`` name attributes
  * Ability to operate on both longitudinal axis orientations, [0, 360) and [-180, 180)

* Support for parallelism using `dask`_ where it is both possible and makes sense
