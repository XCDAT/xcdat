XCDAT: Xarray Extended with Climate Data Analysis Tools
=======================================================

XCDAT is a Python library built on `xarray`_ for climate data analysis on structured grids.
It serves as a spiritual successor to the Community Data Analysis Tools (`CDAT`_) library with a focus on long-term maintainability and extensibility.

Planned Features
-----------------

XCDAT will provide climate domain specific features and utilities that are helpful for general xarray usage.

These features include:

- Support for metadata that is CF compliant, E3SM non-CF compliant, and common
- Robust handling of coordinates and its associated bounds

  - Name-agnostic retrieval of CF compliant coordinates and bounds using ``cf_xarray``
  - Generating a specific or all bounds for supported axes if they don't exist
  - Ability to operate on both [0, 360) and [-180, 180) longitudinal axis orientations

- Temporal averaging (weighted or unweighted)

  - Time series averaging and calculation of climatologies and anomalies
  - Use of time bounds for calculating weights
  - Optional centering of time coordinates using time bounds

- Geospatial weighted averaging over rectilinear grid

  - Optional specification of regional domain

- Horizontal and vertical structured regridding

  - Operate on rectilinear and cuvilinear grids

- Wrappers for opening datasets to apply common operations

  - Generate bounds for all supported axes if they don't exist
  - Decoding of CF and non-CF time units
  - Optional centering of time coordinate using time bounds
  - Optional conversion of longitudinal axes orientation

- Support for parallelism of XCDAT features using Dask

Criteria
~~~~~~~~

The features of this library must meet a set of criteria before being considered for implementation.

1. Climate domain functionality and/or general ``xarray`` utility isn't provided natively with ``xarray``
2. No existing xarray-based packages implement the feature, or the implementation doesn't meet the XCDAT team's defined requirements
3. Feature can be relatively simple to implement and not overly-flexible
4. Feature is often reused
